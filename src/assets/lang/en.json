The difference between the B-1 and the B-2 visa is the intention as to why you are entering the United States. The United States considers that any person seeking to enter the country, has the intention to remain in the country. Thus, any person pursuing a B-1 or B-2 visa, has the burden to demonstrate his or her intention is <strong>to temporarily stay in the country.</strong><p>The B-1 visa is strictly given to people that come to the United States on businesses and plan to do businesses and stay in the country on a temporary basis. Legitimate business includes, among others, conferences, meetings, educational researches, etc. When you apply for a B-1 visa, in addition to proving that you are coming to the country for business reasons and do not plan to remain in the country, you must show that you reside in a country different than the United States; that you have no intention to change such residency; and that you have adequate financial means to support yourself while you stay in the United States. How do you prove that you have no intention to remain in the United States? Usually, the best way to do it is to show strong ties with your country of residence. For example, you may provide any evidence establishing that you work in your country of residence (e.g., paystubs) vehicle registration, property registration etc. Finally, you need to demonstrate that there is nothing that prevents you from entering the United States such as being penalized to come back to the country for exceeding the authorized stay. Not everyone needs a B-1 visa; there are some nationals of certain countries that are allowed to enter the United States without a visa.</p><p>The B-2 Visa is the tourist visa. This is the visa you use when you want to come to the United States for pleasure (e.g., vacation), medical treatment, short “recreational courses” (e.g., a 5-day meditation class) or amateur/non-professional contexts. Depending on your country of origin, you may not need to obtain a B-2 visa, as it is the case with B-1 visas. The specific requirements to obtain this visa vary depending on the country of origin.</p><p>You must apply to the United States Embassy or Consulate in your resident country to obtain a B-1/ B-2 visa. As visa processing can involve lengthy delays, it is recommended to apply as early as possible in your visa pursuit.</p><p>The steps to apply for your visa are:</p><ol><li>1. Complete Form DS-160 (always print the confirmation page and bring it to your visa appointment)</li><li>2. If required, pay the visa fee (remember, it is not refundable!)</li></ol> ",

  "visaDetails_businessVisas_e-2-visa_description": "E-2 visas are employment-based visas that allow individuals to come to the United States and work. There are two classifications of E-2 visas: E-2 Treaty Investor and E-2 Employee of a Treaty Investor. E-2 Treaty Investor visas are for individuals that want to come to the United States to invest in and run a bona fide enterprise.  The E-2 visa is a temporary visa that allows the individual a temporary stay in the United States. In order to qualify for an E-2 Treaty Investor visa, the individual must be a national of a particular country that has a particular treaty with the United States. Many countries have a qualifying treaty with the United States.<p>For E-2 Treaty Investor visas, the individual must be coming to the United States to invest in an enterprise and develop and direct that enterprise. E-2 Treaty Investors visa does not give the individual the right to work for any enterprise in the United States, only the enterprise for which the E-2 visa was issued for.</p><p>There are several requirements in order to receive an E-2 Visa. First, the individual must invest in a United States commercial enterprise that is real and operating. E-2 Treaty Investors have the option of starting a business from scratch or purchasing an existing business. Second, the investment must be a substantial investment of capital into the business. Whether an investment is substantial depends on the business itself—some business will require more investment than others. Third, the investment must come from legal sources and proof must be shown of the entire investment—from when the individual acquired the capital to invest through the transfer to the United States to the commercial enterprise. Fourth, the investment must carry the risk of total loss and must be irrevocably committed. Fifth, the investment cannot be marginal in nature. A marginal enterprise is defined as an enterprise that cannot currently, nor will it be able to in the future, have the ability to generate more than enough income to provide a minimal living for the E-2 Treaty Investor and his or her family. Finally, the individual must be in a position to direct and develop the enterprise. The individual must either own at least 50% of the enterprise or retain operational control of the enterprise through a managerial position or some other corporate position.</p><p>E-2 Employee of Treaty Investor visas are for individuals who are seeking to be employed at a U.S enterprise that is owned by an E-2 Treaty Investor or to working directly for an E-2 Treaty Investor. There are several requirements in order to receive an E-2 Visa. First, the employee must have the same nationality of the employer. If the employer is not an individual, the enterprise must be at least 50% owned by individuals in the United States that have the nationality of the treaty country and those owners must have valid E-2 Treaty Investor status. Second, the employee must meet the traditional definition of an employee under the proper law. Finally, the employee must have executive or supervisory duties or if the employee does not, then the employee must have special qualifications.</p><p>If the individual is in the United States in another lawful status, he or she may seek to petition USCIS to change his or her status to E-2 Treaty Investor or E-2 Employee of a Treaty Investor so long as the individual enter the United States with the treaty country passport. Otherwise, the individual must apply for the visa at the United States Consulate abroad. Applying for an E-2 Visa has severely legal intricacies to it and can be very difficult. If you are interested in learning how you may qualify for an E-2 Visa, more about the process and applying for an E-2 Visa online, please schedule a consultation today.</p><p></p>",

  "visaDetails_individualVisas_f-1-visa_description": "A student visa is issued for people who want to study in the United States. One of the main requirements of an F-1 visa is that the person needs to be enrolled in a full-time academic program. The United States considers that any person seeking to enter the country, has the intention to remain in the country. This applies to student visas. Therefore, the person applying for a student visa, must demonstrate that she/he does not intend to remain in the country after completing their studies. The way a student visa is processed depends on whether you are applying for a student visa in your resident country or while you are in the United States under other non-immigrant status. If you are applying in your resident country for an F-1 visa, you would need to follow the same steps as applying for a B-1/B-2 visa. First, you need to enroll in a school or academy that is endorsed by the Student and Exchange Visitors Program, Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The course or academic program has to be a full-time course and has to conclude with a certificate, degree, diploma or similar. Additionally, your English language competency must be sufficient to effectively attend classes. If you think your English language level is not adequate for the class you are attending, you can enroll in a full-time English course. Once you enroll in an endorsed academic institute, the educational institution will provide you with an I-20 form). Once obtained, the student must pay the Student Exchange Visitor Program’s fees. Subsequently, when filing for an F-1 visa you must prove that you have adequate financial means to support yourself during the complete stay of your studies and that you have the intent to go back to your country of residence. How do you prove your intent to return? You should demonstrate that you have strong ties with your country of residence. For example, you may provide any evidence establishing that you work in your country of residence (e.g., paystubs) vehicles registration, property registration etc. Finally, you need to demonstrate that there is nothing that prevents you from entering the United States as being penalized to come back to the country for exceeding the authorized stay.<p>If you are in the United States and want to apply for a F-1 visa, therefore change your immigrant status, you might consider obtaining professional legal assistance. There are several rules and complexities involved and if you are not aware of those, your F-1 visa can be easily denied.  If you are in your country of residence, the steps to follow once you have obtained the I-20 are:</p><ol><li>1. Complete Form DS-160 (always print the confirmation page and bring it to your visa appointment)</li><li>2. If required, pay the visa fee (remember, it is not refundable!)</li></ol><p>Finally, F-1 students are allowed to overstay their visa for a period of 60 days maximum. If the student wants to work, there are some specific rules that apply.</p>",

If you want to accompany your family member while he or she is taking a full-time academic program in the United States, you would apply for an F-2 visa.  F-2 visas are issued for family members and dependents of the holder of an F-1 visa. Dependents are the spouse and children of the F-1 holder. To prove that you are a dependent of an F-1 visa holder you must provide a marriage certificate; birth certificates should be provided as proof of parent-child relationship with the F-1 holder. Applying for an F-2 visa can be done concurrently with the F-1 application or separately. To obtain an F-2 visa, the student must be admitted in F-1 status. F-2 holders are not allowed to study or work during their stay in the United States. When filing for an F-2 visa you must prove that you have adequate financial means to support yourself during the complete duration of the F-1 holder’s studies and that you have the intention to return to your country of residence. How do you prove your intent to return? You should demonstrate that you have strong ties with your country of residence. For example, you may provide any evidence establishing that you work in your country of residence (e.g., paystubs) vehicles registration, property registration etc. Finally, you need to demonstrate that there is nothing that prevents you to enter the United States as being penalized to come back to the country for exceeding the authorized stay. If you are in the United States and want to apply for an F-2 visa, therefore change your status, you might consider obtaining professional legal assistance. There are several rules and intricacies involved that can prevent you from obtaining an F-2 status. Similar to F-1 students, the F-1 dependents need to obtain an I-20 from the F-1 student’s academic institute. If you are in your country of residence, the steps to follow after getting the I-20 are:<ol><li>1. Complete Form DS-160 (always print the confirmation page and bring it to your visa appointment)</li><li>2. If required, pay the visa fee (remember, it is not refundable!)</li></ol>",

  "visaDetails_businessVisas_o-1-visa_description": "The O-1 Visa is used to obtain nonimmigrant visas to individuals that can show that he or she has an extraordinary ability or extraordinary achievement. There are two subclasses for the O-1 visa classification. O-1A visas are used for persons with an extraordinary ability in education, the sciences, business or athletics. O-1A visas do not include the any persons from the arts or motion picture and television industries. Individuals with an extraordinary ability in the arts or extraordinary achievement in the motion picture or television industries would qualify for an O-1B visa.<p>Individuals applying for an O-1 visa must be coming to the United States to work. Therefore, the individual must have an employment contract, either written or oral, with a United States employer. If there is an oral agreement in place, the individual must provide a summary of the terms of the agreement, including what was offered by the employer and what was accepted by the employee. In order for the employment to qualify in the O-1 classification, the employment must be in the area of the individual’s extraordinary ability.</p><p>Another requirement for O-1 visa applicants is that individual must have a consultation from an appropriate peer group regarding the individual’s extraordinary ability or achievement. A consultation is provided in the form of a written advisory opinion from the appropriate peer group. Peer group can include labor organizations. The goal of this requirement is to have a United States-based organization verify the extraordinariness of the individual. If an appropriate peer group or labor organization does not exist for the particular field that the individual possesses an extraordinary ability or achievement, the O-1 may still be applied for and USCIS will review the petition on its merit without the consultation. For O-1B individuals, a consultation provided in a previous O-1B petition may be reused in a renewal petition so long as the individual will provide similar services and not more than 2 years have passed since the consultation was issued.</p><p>Another requirement for the O-1 visa is that the petitioner must provide an itinerary of the events and/or activities that the individual will take part in while in the United States. This itinerary must include start and finish dates for the events and/or activities as well as the nature of the events and/or activities. The events and/or activities listed in the itinerary must be within the individual’s field of extraordinary ability. If having an itinerary is not typical for someone in the field of the extraordinary individual, then no itinerary is required.</p><p>Additionally, to qualify for an O-1 visa, the petitioner must meet an evidentiary criteria showing national or international recognition for the individual’s extraordinary ability or achievements. For O-1A visas, the following evidence criteria must be provided and proven:</p><li>a major and internationally recognized award; or At least 3 of the following</li><li>a nationally or internationally recognized price or award for excellence in the individual’s field; </li><li>membership in an association that requires outstanding achievements in the individual’s field; </li><li>published material about the individual’s work in the individual’s field in professional or major trade publications, newspapers or other major media; </li><li>original scientific, scholarly or business-related contributions of major significance in the individual’s field; </li><li>authorship of scholarly articles in professional journals or other major media in the individual’s field; </li><li>a high salary or other remuneration for services provided in the individual’s field; </li><li>participation on a panel, or individually, as a judge of the work of others in the individual’s field or a closely-related field; </li><li>employment in a critical or essential capacity for organizations and establishments that have a distinguished reputation. </li><p>For O-1B visas, the following evidence criteria must be provided and proven:</p><li>received or been nominated for, significant national or international awards or prices in the field; or</li><li>At least 3 of the following</li><li>performed and will perform services as a lead or starring participant in events or productions which have a distinguished reputation; </li><li>achieved national or international recognition for achievements; </li><li>performed and will perform in a lead, starring or critical role for organizations establishments that have a distinguished reputation; </li><li>a record of major commercial or critically acclaimed successes; </li><li>received significant recognition for achievements from critics, government agencies, organizations or other recognized experts in the individual’s field; </li><li>a high salary or other remuneration for services provided in the individual’s field. </li><p>O-1 petitions must be filed with USCIS regardless of whether the individual is outside the United States. If the individual is in the United States in another lawful status, the individual may seek to have the petitioner request that USCIS change the individual status to O-1. If the individual is outside the United States, after receiving approval from USCIS, he or she may apply for an O-1 visa at the local United States Consulate. Applying for O-1 status has severely legal intricacies to it and can be very difficult. If you are interested in learning how you may qualify for an O-1 visa, more about the process and applying for an O-1 Visa online, please schedule a consultation today.</p>",

The most common relationship between the foreign company and the U.S. company is the one of a holding company controlling the branch, division, affiliate or subsidiary or sister companies. In other words, the ownership and control must be common to both the foreign and the US company and the foreign company shall control the U.S Company. The “control element” is usually demonstrated through ownership; i.e., the foreign company owns 51% of the U.S company or vice versa. <p></p><p>The petitioner of the L-1 visa is the U.S. Company and the beneficiary is the worker or employee of the foreign entity who has worked in a managerial, executive or specialized knowledge position for at least one continuous year during the last 3 years prior to applying for the L-1 visa. The U.S company has to demonstrate it is ready and capable of hiring the employee in a managerial, executive or specialized knowledge position and that it will continue operations during the L-1 beneficiary stay in the U.S.  Managers and executives will obtain an L-1A visa while employees with specialized knowledge will receive an L-1B visa.</p> <p></p><p>If the U.S Company is a new company, the L-1 visa will be issued for an initial duration of one year. After the first year, the U.S company must demonstrate that it will continue operations in the U.S. and request to renew the employee’s L-1 visa. If the U.S company is not a new company, the initial period allowed is 3 years.  Additionally, beneficiaries applying for a managerial or executive position may stay in the U.S. for a maximum of 7 years while the specialized knowledge position allows a maximum of 5 years of stay in the U.S.</p> <p></p><p>If you are located outside the United States, once you get the approval of the L-1 visa you can schedule an appointment at the U.S. Embassy or Consulate of your country of residence. If your L-1 visa is approved while you are in the United States, the next step is to apply for an adjustment of status provided you were in valid status when applying for the L-1 visa.</p> <p></p><p>Finally, spouses and children under the age of 21 years will obtain an L-2 status. As an L-2, the spouse has a right to work although USCIS recommends independently applying for a work authorization via Form I-765. L-2 children have the right to attend school. However, children are not allowed to accept paid jobs.</p>",
